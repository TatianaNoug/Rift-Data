# Rift-Data

We are building this project for our latest year in engineering studies at ECE Paris. The goal of this project is to build an application which is easy to deploy and that can be sold to e-sports organisations to have some statistics and predictions about the different champions that we can find in League of Legends.

## Technologies used
  
  To build this application we wanted to rely on NodeJS for the back and react for the front.
  As DBMS we choosed to use MongoDB as our data are going to be semi structured and as we want to do real-time data for the future.
  Finally for the ML part, we will use Spark to do the machine learning for our app.
